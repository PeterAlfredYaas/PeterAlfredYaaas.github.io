  <p> Hello, and welcome to All About Peter by Peter!</p>
  <p> Where do I even begin?</p>
  <p> I'm 21 years old and I am from sunny Southern California- an awful town called Riverside! FUN FACT: If you or your peers have ever done crystal meth, chances are, it came from Riverside. I'm a dancer and I'm at the New School for Public Engagement where I am focusing on Arts administration/development. I want all young kids to be as lucky as I've been and have access to the arts, dance, and theatre. </p>
  <p>I have a dog, whose actual name is Jack (legally), but I call him Mary Kate. He's the best! Yes he goes by he pronouns because who cares about the patriarchy? </p>
  <p>I enjoy and appreciate a wide variety of music but some of my favorites include: Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, Troye Sivan, Two Door Cinema Club,  Marian Hill, Halsey, Madonna, David Bowie, Prince, and I could probably go on and on and on but I'll stop right there </p>  
    <ul> Life is about choices is a personal mantra/philosophy of mine because it's absolutely true in every single situation.
      <li> "Can I use the restroom?" </li>
      <li> "Life is about Choices!"</li>
      <li> "Should I adopt a puppy?</li>
      <li> "Life is about CHOICES!"</li>
      <li> "Have you done the Homework for Web Fundamentals?" </li>
     <h2> "LIFE is ABOUT CHOICES! </h2>
  <p> See? You can effortlessly glide "Life is About Choices" into any conversation!</p>
